        This game offers an interactive and enjoyable experience for players of all ages. The game logic was implemented using Vanilla JavaScript. Each player has their turn and respective score. Once a winner is declared, the board prevents further gameplay by disabling the cells, and it also features a button that resets all the cells. This is a project that is fully responsive.
